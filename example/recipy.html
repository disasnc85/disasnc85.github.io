<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

 <p><strong> <u>This</u> recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of
    different
    recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</em><br>
<em>175g of tahini</em><br>
<em>6 sundried tomatoes</em><br>
<em>Half a red pepper</em><br>
<em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em><br>
<em>1 clove of garlic</em><br>
<em>A dash of olive oil</em><br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

        skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
    </mark>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time

, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus &lt;br&gt; l&apos; in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a
    week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>
<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
